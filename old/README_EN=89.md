# Network Monitor

> [🇨🇳 中文](README.md) | 🇬🇧 English

A full-featured BitTorrent Tracker monitoring tool with TCP/UDP ping, multi-IP monitoring, IPv4+IPv6 dual-stack, uptime ranking, SOCKS5 proxy support, and multi-account permission management.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Monitoring
- ✅ TCPing detection (HTTP/HTTPS Trackers)
- ✅ UDPing detection (UDP Tracker BEP 15 protocol handshake)
- ✅ Multi-IP monitoring per domain — expand rows to view per-IP details
- ✅ Full IPv4 + IPv6 dual-stack resolution and monitoring
- ✅ Direct `IP:port` format support
- ✅ Configurable concurrent check threads (default 120, recommended 30–200)
- ✅ Auto-retry on failure (polling mode: 5s → 15s → 30s → 60s increasing intervals)

### Uptime Statistics
- ✅ 24-hour / 7-day / 30-day uptime rankings
- ✅ Separate stat period config for monitor list and ranking
- ✅ Persistent uptime history cache (survives restarts)
- ✅ Health color coding:
  - 🟢 Green: uptime >80%, or all IPs online
  - 🟡 Yellow: uptime 50–80%, or mixed online/offline (takes priority display)
  - 🔴 Red: uptime <50%, or all IPs offline
- ✅ Latency bar colors: green ≤500ms, yellow 500–1500ms, red >1500ms or timeout

### Dashboard
- ✅ 6-card live stats: Total IPs / Online IPs / Offline IPs / Avg Latency (with P95) / IPv4÷IPv6 / Active Alerts
- ✅ Uptime Ranking TOP10 (toggle Worst / Best)
- ✅ Alert Center: auto-triggers after ≥5 consecutive failures, shows IP location, ISP, current status
- ✅ Error log aggregation: deduplication with first occurrence time, count, and IP geolocation
- ✅ Quick Search (global): displays all monitored entries by default, paginated (10/page); click a domain to filter and show all its IPs
- ✅ Quick Search supports: domain / IP / ISP / country / status / protocol (http/https/udp)

### Proxy Support
- ✅ HTTP CONNECT proxy for HTTP/HTTPS Trackers
- ✅ SOCKS5 proxy for UDP Trackers (RFC 1928 manual implementation, no PySocks required)
- ✅ Persistent SOCKS5 connection: TCP control kept alive globally, all threads share one fixed UDP source port
- ✅ Fixed source port solves SOCKS5 relay source port filter packet drop
- ✅ `transaction_id` multiplexing — concurrent threads without interference
- ✅ Proxy health state machine: 2 consecutive failures → 30s cooldown, probes skipped during cooldown
- ✅ Last-known state preserved when proxy is unavailable — **uptime data stays clean**
- ✅ Smart dual-stack proxy address: IPv6 preferred, auto-fallback to IPv4
- ✅ `localhost` dual-stack ambiguity handling (auto-switches to `127.0.0.1` if proxy only listens on IPv4)
- ✅ SO_KEEPALIVE to prevent silent NAT/firewall disconnection
- ✅ Auto-reconnect if TCP control connection drops

### DNS Resolution
- ✅ Three DNS modes: System DNS / dnspython / Custom DNS server
- ✅ Local hosts file support (via getaddrinfo native behavior)
- ✅ Re-resolves every check cycle — automatically detects IP changes
- ✅ Falls back to cached IPs on DNS failure — monitoring never stops

### Monitor List
- ✅ Card-style layout showing port, protocol (TCP/UDP), IP count, and added time
- ✅ Expanded rows show per-IP status, uptime, latency, country, ISP, and last check time
- ✅ Monospace IP display — IPv4 in green, IPv6 in indigo, with v4/v6 badge labels
- ✅ TCP IPs auto-labeled HTTP / HTTPS (port 443 = HTTPS)
- ✅ IP column header: tri-state click — expand ≤5 IPs / expand all / collapse all
- ✅ Removed (historical) IPs shown in translucent gray — can be hidden in config
- ✅ Toolbar filters: ALL / IPv4 / IPv6 · ALL / TCP / UDP / HTTP / HTTPS · status · keyword search
- ✅ Sorting: uptime / domain / latency / added time / last check / port, with asc/desc/reset tri-state
- ✅ Status/uptime column header shows current stat period (24h / 7d / 30d)
- ✅ Latency visualization bar (color changes dynamically with latency)
- ✅ Per-IP retry button for offline IPs (immediate, bypasses polling wait)
- ✅ Bulk add Trackers (multi-line paste, lines starting with `|` auto-skipped)
- ✅ Pause/resume monitoring (per IP, per domain, or all)

### Uptime Ranking
- ✅ Domain entries show TCP/UDP protocol tag + v4/v6 version badges
- ✅ Displays active IP count and online count
- ✅ Minimum uptime filter (50% / 80% / 90% / 100%)
- ✅ Protocol filter: ALL / TCP / UDP
- ✅ IP version filter: ALL / IPv4 / IPv6
- ✅ One-click TXT export (**what you see is what you export** — filtered results downloaded directly, no server request needed)

### Network Health Detection
- ✅ Multi-target probes (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1 / 114.114.114.114 :53) — any reachable = network OK
- ✅ Dual safeguard: probe status + per-round failure rate (≥90% failures = local network issue)
- ✅ When network is unhealthy, round history is excluded from stats to prevent mass false data

### IP Geolocation
- ✅ Automatic country and ISP lookup via ip-api.com (locally cached)
- ✅ Background repair thread on startup: re-queries any Unknown IPs (10s delay, 0.5s/IP rate limit)
- ✅ Per-check auto-retry for still-Unknown IPs, runs outside the check lock (non-blocking)

### UI & Interaction
- ✅ Light/dark theme toggle — IPv4/IPv6 colors readable in both themes
- ✅ Page zoom (50%–100%) adjustable in the navbar, saved to Cookie; default also configurable (Cookie takes priority)
- ✅ Multi-language: 中文 / English / Русский / Français / 日本語 / 한국어
- ✅ URL Hash routing (`#/trackers`, `#/ranking`, etc.)
- ✅ `ESC` key clears any search box instantly
- ✅ Log search: type `error` / `warn` / `info` to filter by log level directly
- ✅ Toast notifications for operation feedback
- ✅ gzip compression (HTML ~210KB → ~48KB) + ETag negotiation cache (304 when unchanged)

### Account & Permissions
- ✅ Three-tier role system: admin / operator / viewer
  - `admin`: full access including config, user management, log clearing; no retry rate limit
  - `operator`: add/delete Trackers, retry (500ms cooldown)
  - `viewer`: read-only, retry (1s cooldown)
- ✅ Config auto-refreshes on login — no manual F5 needed
- ✅ Login failure rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- ✅ Signed Session Cookie (`session_secret.key`), persists across restarts
- ✅ Unauthenticated users only receive the minimal public config fields — no operational details exposed

### System & Operations
- ✅ Waitress production server (no Flask dev-mode warnings)
- ✅ Local static assets (`static/` directory) — fully offline deployment, no CDN required
- ✅ All config persisted to `config.json`, loaded on restart
- ✅ Log levels: `none` / `info` / `error` / `debug`
- ✅ Config change logs only show actually-changed fields (with human-readable labels and units)
- ✅ Optional disk logging to `error.log`, filterable by level

## ⚠️ Security Notes

### `session_secret.key`

This file is the signing key for Flask Session Cookies. **Never commit it to a public repository.** If leaked, anyone can forge a Cookie and gain admin access without a password.

**Add to `.gitignore`:**

```gitignore
session_secret.key
config.json
data.json
error.log
```

**How to reset the key:**

```bash
# Option 1: delete the file — a new one is auto-generated on next start
del session_secret.key        # Windows
rm session_secret.key         # Linux/macOS

# Option 2: generate a new key manually
python -c "import os; open('session_secret.key','wb').write(os.urandom(32))"
```

After resetting, all active sessions are immediately invalidated — users must log in again.

### Default Credentials

**Change these immediately** after first run (Config → User Management):

| Account | Default Password | Role |
|---------|-----------------|------|
| admin | admin | Full access |
| operator | operator | Add/delete Trackers |
| viewer | viewer | Read-only |

## 🔒 Proxy Configuration

### UDP Proxy (SOCKS5)

UDP Tracker probing is forwarded via SOCKS5 UDP Associate, fully implementing RFC 1928 with no third-party dependencies.

```json
{
  "udp_proxy": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080",
  "proxy_enabled": true
}
```

**How it works:** The app establishes a persistent TCP control connection to the SOCKS5 proxy and negotiates a UDP relay address via UDP Associate. All monitoring threads share one UDP socket with a fixed source port, using `transaction_id` to demultiplex responses.

**Notes:**
- Proxy must support UDP Associate (CMD=0x03)
- Supports `localhost`, IPv4, IPv6 (`[::1]:port` format)
- `localhost` tries IPv6 (`::1`) first, auto-falls back to `127.0.0.1` if needed
- When proxy is unavailable, UDP checks are skipped and last-known status is preserved

### HTTP Proxy

```json
{
  "http_proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",
  "proxy_enabled": true
}
```

## ❌ Offline Reason Reference

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Timeout (>Xs)` | No response within the timeout window |
| `Port unreachable` | Target actively refused (ICMP Port Unreachable / TCP RST) |
| `Proxy connection failed` | SOCKS5 proxy itself failed to connect or handshake |
| `Proxy unavailable (retry in Xs)` | Proxy in cooldown; probe skipped, last state retained |
| `Invalid response` | Received reply but format doesn't match protocol |

## ❓ FAQ

**1. Can't start the server?**
```bash
pip install Flask flask-cors dnspython requests waitress
```

**2. `index.html` not found?**
Make sure `index.html` is in the same directory as `app.py`, or inside a `templates/` subdirectory.

**3. Port already in use?**
Edit `config.json` and change the `port` field, or change `DEFAULT_CONFIG['port']` in `app.py`.

**4. Rankings page is empty?**
Rankings require accumulated history. Newly added trackers need a few check cycles before appearing. Enable "Cache Uptime Stats" to retain history across restarts.

**5. Some IP geolocations are empty?**
On startup, a background repair thread automatically re-queries any Unknown IPs (starts after 10s, rate-limited to 0.5s/IP). No manual action needed. You can verify ip-api.com connectivity with:
```bash
curl -s "http://ip-api.com/json/1.2.3.4?fields=country,countryCode,isp"
```

**6. Only some IPs resolved?**
Ensure your network supports IPv6, or switch DNS mode to `dnspython` or `custom`. The app queries both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records simultaneously.

**7. UDP proxy shows all timeouts?**
Confirm your proxy software has UDP forwarding enabled. Many proxies only support TCP by default — UDP Associate must be explicitly enabled.

**8. Large number of offline IPs when proxy is down?**
After 2 consecutive proxy failures, a 30s cooldown kicks in. All UDP probes are skipped during cooldown with last-known states preserved — no false offline reports.

**9. How to manage multi-user access?**
Go to Config → User Management to add accounts and assign roles: admin (full) / operator (add/delete trackers) / viewer (read-only).

**10. Using `localhost` proxy but connection fails?**
The app tries IPv6 (`::1`) first. If your proxy only listens on IPv4, it auto-falls back to `127.0.0.1`. If still failing, use `socks5://127.0.0.1:port` directly.
